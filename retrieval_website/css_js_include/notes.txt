Manintainability notes:

  Most of the template should update automatically upon copying the new version 
  of the folder /shared/ets from one of the cf servers.  However, the footer 
  (footer.html), left nar bar seperators (in login.css), and Data & Automation 
  logo (bannerLogo.css) are modified versions contained in the local 
  css_js_includes directory.
