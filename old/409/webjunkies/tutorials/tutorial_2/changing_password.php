<div class="tutorialParagraph">You can change your password quite easily using the 'passwd' command.  It is a good habit to get into to change your password from time to time for added security measures.  At the terminal prompt, type:<br /><br />
<em>passwd</em>
You will be prompted to supply your old password. So ensure that you at least remember that. <br /><br />
Once you have supplied your old password correctly, you will be asked to type in your new password. To make sure you typed that correctly, you'll enter it twice.<br /><br />
Make sure your new password is 6-8 characters long, includes a capital or a number, and you're good to go! <br /><br />

Next, you'll learn a bit about text editors and how they are used in UNIX...<br />
