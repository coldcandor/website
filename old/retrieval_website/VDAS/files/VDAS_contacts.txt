// Lines beginning with "//" will be ignored.  In other words, these are
//   comments.
// Lines beginning with "---" will be used as headers in the table.  These lines
//   cannot appear inside of an entry, i.e. between the two paragraphs of
//   information about a contact.  No line breaks are allowed inside a title.
//   In other words, a title must only be one line, but as many characters as
//   desired.

// Here's the format that will be used for this file.
// 
// The first line will consist of the contact's name, followed by Parenthized
// (enclosed in parentheses) a very short description of the contact (optional),
// such as a title or location, followed by " - ", followed by the phone number
// (delimited with periods, i.e. 555.555.5555) and an optional extension (i.e.
// 555.555.5555 ext 5555)
//
// NOTE:  If the syntax of the first line is used in any of the paragraphs,
// the results are undefined!
//
// After the first line, extra paragraphs of information are allowed.  These
// paragraphs can contain whatever you wish.  There must be a blank line between
// them as well as following the final paragraph.
//
// White space (spaces, tabs, etc) at the start or end of each line will be
// removed, but can be used in this file to help keep it readable.
//
// Entries will appear on the webpage in the order they are in this file.

// The following is an example of the format to use.

//--- Example ---
//
// Example Name (Title or similar info) - 555.555.5555
//   This is a paragraph of additional information about the name above it, such
//   as a mini-bio, description of the person's relation to VDAS, etc.
//
//   This is a second paragraph of additional information, such as additional
//   phone numbers, email, etc.
