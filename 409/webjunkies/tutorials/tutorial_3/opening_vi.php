<div class="tutorialParagraph">VI is another popular text editor that works in UNIX.  VI is more powerful than pico because of its extra features, and is normally used by more experienced UNIX programmers.  It is a good program to get to know for all users, however, and can be a powerful programming tool if you know how to use it.</div>

<p class="tutorialSubtitle"><img src="../images/dot.gif" alt="dot" />&nbsp; Opening VI </p>
<div class="tutorialParagraph">In your UNIX session, you can access the VI editor similiarly to the way you would Pico. Simply type:<br /><br />
<em>vi filename.ext</em><br /><br />
You should end up with a screen like this:<br /><br />
<img src="images/vi.jpg" width="450" alt="vi"/><br /><br />
The VIU editor should be lined with tides ('~') all down the left, while the last line shows the filename and its length. If the file has not been edited, it will say '[newfile]'<br /><br />
