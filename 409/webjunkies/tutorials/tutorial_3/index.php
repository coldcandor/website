<div class="tutorialParagraph">This tutorial will cover two of the most important text editing programs available to UNIX users today.  Both are different and know for different reasons.  These programs will give you the ability to manipulate your files easily and to your liking, without having to leave the UNIX environment.  This tutorial will show you how to access these programs, change the contents using the programs commands, and save and quit the programs, as well. Pico is a very simple, easy to use program and is great for beginners.  VI is a little bit more complicated, as it has a few more features, but is a good program to know, as well.</div>
