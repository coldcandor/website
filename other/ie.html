<p>It has been detected that you are useing the horrible invention known as Internet Explorer.  Unfortunately, I do not have the time to deal with the ridiculous amount of extra work that IE requires to make things work as they should.  In addition, I will not be responsible for the website psedu-working, and potentially causing problems due to the use of IE.  Hence you are seeing this page.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there's an easy solution to this! All you need to do is visit <a href="http://www.firefox.com">http://www.firefox.com</a>, download, and install Firefox. Firefox is a free, powerful, and easy to use web browser. In addition, Firefox leads the industry in online security! Why not make your life (and mine) easier, and safer too?</p>
<p>If you can not or do not wish to do this, then unfortunately, this site will be lost to you. Sorry for the inconvianence this causes, but until Microsoft makes their browser standards-compliant, those that wish to use it will be at a significant disadvantage.</p>
