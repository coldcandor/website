      <p>This is a temporary page to simply give links to the projects I've done over the last couple years.  Eventually, this will in itself be a full website, but currently my Guild site takes priority.</p>
      <p>All websites that I make are designed for Firefox and other W3 standards compliant browers first, IE second.  If it doesn't seem to look or work right in IE, it's most likely because I didn't deem it worth the time and/or effort required to cater to IE's ridiculous special needs for that site.  One of the requirements of the Website Design class and the site made for Honeywell was functionality in IE, so those will work.  The others have no such gaurentee.</p>
      <p>I have never and will never use a software package to program or create sites for me, unless required by the people I work for.  Whenever remotely possible, I code using a simple text editor.</p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://old.coldcandor.com/409/assignment_1/" target="_blank">Individual Assignment #1</a> - A simple website who's purpose is to create something using HTML and CSS that contains links to the other sites made for the class.</li>
            <li><a href="http://old.coldcandor.com/409/assignment_2/" target="_blank">Individual Assignment #2</a> - The first version of a website dedicated to a movie.  Nothing but pure HTML and CSS is used here.</li>
            <li><a href="http://old.coldcandor.com/409/assignment_3/" target="_blank">Individual Assignment #3</a> - The final version of assignment #2.  This is to be a refined version that makes use of at least one higher complexity language or skill, such as Javascript.</li>

            <li><a href="http://old.coldcandor.com/409/assignment_1/design_doc.pdf" target="_blank">Group Assignment #1</a> - A design document created for the major group project.  The complete process was used in this document, from questioning the end-users to multiple template versions for the look of the site.  The file presented here is a PDF.</li>
            <li><a href="http://old.coldcandor.com/409/webjunkies/" target="_blank">Group Assignment #2</a> - Final version of the UNIX Tutorial Website, our major group project.  This site uses extensive PHP and Javascript.  I was the group leader for this project.</li>

            <li><a href="http://old.coldcandor.com/retrieval_website/" target="_blank">Engine Test Data Retrieval Website</a> - This is a modified version of the site I made for Honeywell Aerospace in 2006.  All important information has been removed and the site is presented here so that I may present it as an example of what I've created.  It uses PHP login sessions, extensive PHP and javascript programming to make interactive pages, and is created using the Fusebox PHP framework.</li>

            <li><a href="http://ebookformat.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Home site for eBookFormatter</a> - eBookFormatter was a project I worked on for a couple months in the fall of 2005, it's purpose to format story-like text documents in a nice way according to some options given to a command line program.  The program was written in PHP and requires version 5 to run correctly.</li>
            <li><a href="http://freedomschoice.coldcandor.com/" target="_blank">Freedom's Choice Guild Website</a> - My guild in World of Warcraft, Freedom's Choice, had only a simple website, probably for the sake of having one, so I felt I could contribute by making a fuller, more useful website.  This is the ongoing result.  Started in January 2007.</li>
