      <p>This is my online portfolio.</p>
      <p>All websites that I make are designed for W3 standards compliant browers.  Development work is done in Firefox, so it may have oddities that I never got around to fixing in other browsers, especially older versions of IE.  </p>
      <p>I have never and will never use a software package to create code or sites for me, unless required by the people I work for.  Whenever remotely possible, I code using a simple text editor, namely jEdit.  I will make use of some pre-made libraries however, such as jQuery.</p>
      <p>Finally, as of about February 2011, all aspects of my website (including all sites below) are hosted on a private server setup and configured by myself, using the standard LAMP arrangement.  I am more proud of this accomplishment than I could have thought possible.  The only external service that of buying my domain name.</p>

        <li>Website Design and Implementation Class at RIT (Spring 2006)
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://old.coldcandor.com/409/assignment_1/" target="_blank">Individual Assignment #1</a> - A simple website who's purpose is to create something using HTML and CSS that contains links to the other sites made for the class.</li>
            <li><a href="http://old.coldcandor.com/409/assignment_2/" target="_blank">Individual Assignment #2</a> - The first version of a website dedicated to a movie.  Nothing but pure HTML and CSS is used here.</li>
            <li><a href="http://old.coldcandor.com/409/assignment_3/index.shtml" target="_blank">Individual Assignment #3</a> - The final version of assignment #2.  This is to be a refined version that makes use of at least one higher complexity language or skill, such as Javascript.</li>
            <br />
            <li><a href="http://old.coldcandor.com/409/assignment_1/design_doc.pdf" target="_blank">Group Assignment #1</a> - The design document created for our major group project.  The complete process was used in this document, from questioning the end-users to multiple template versions for the look of the site.  The file presented here is a PDF.</li>
            <li><a href="http://old.coldcandor.com/409/webjunkies/" target="_blank">Group Assignment #2</a> - Final version of the UNIX Tutorial Website, our major group project.  This site uses extensive PHP and Javascript.  I was the group leader for this project.</li>

<!--            <li><a href="http://old.coldcandor.com/retrieval_website/" target="_blank">Engine Test Data Retrieval Website</a> -             It appears Fusebox has been broken by my latest moving of web hosting.  I hope to fix this at some point.
<br />
This is a modified version of the site I made for Honeywell Aerospace in 2006.  All important information has been removed and the site is presented here so that I may present it as an example of what I've created.  It uses PHP login sessions, extensive PHP and javascript programming to make interactive pages, and is created using the Fusebox PHP framework.</li> -->
            <li>I have done the cutup work (converting a design image into HTML and CSS) for many pieces of Synacor's portal, as well as a substantial amount of Javascript for the TV Everywhere product.  I hope to find some time to create a portfolio of such things, but that's easier said than done!</li>

            <li><p><a href="http://www.coldcandor.com">My personal website</a> - After Website Design and Implementation in college, it seemed appropriate to have a personal website.  While the site itself never really developed a purpose, it has served as a portfolio, image host, and a testbed for ideas and functional practice.  The site is now hosted on a server located in the living room, with all steps to create a web server (VirtualBox, Ubutnu Server, Apache, networking, MySQL, Git, etc) having been completed personally. The site has numerous subdomains, a  <a href="http://beta.coldcandor.com">beta</a> version, and Git-based versioning.</p></li>
<!--            <li><a href="http://ebookformat.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Home site for eBookFormatter</a> - eBookFormatter was a project I worked on for a couple months in the fall of 2005, it's purpose to format story-like text documents in a nice way according to some options given to a command line program.  The program was written in PHP and requires version 5 to run correctly.</li>-->
            <li><a href="http://freedomschoice.coldcandor.com/" target="_blank">Freedom's Choice Guild Website</a> - This was a self-motivated project to create a highly functional website for a World of Warcraft guild.  Written in PHP, XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the site caters to the many needs of a guild, including an interactive calendar, a screenshot uploader and viewer, a registration and login system, announcement system, and more.  A MySQL database is used to maintain many features of the site.  The website is located at <a target="_blank" href="http://freedomschoice.coldcandor.com">http://freedomschoice.coldcandor.com</a>, preserved as it was in 2007, except that the announcements and logins were wiped.  You may login using eshields/12345. Started in January 2007 and abandoned when the guild disbanded somewhere between August 2007 and April 2008.
            <br />
            Note that this site is blocked to browsers older than IE8, as I do not have the time or desire to ensure older versions won't do something worse than render badly.</li>
